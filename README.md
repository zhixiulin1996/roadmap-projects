# Roadmap.sh Mini Projects Collection

## Purpose
This repository serves as a personal workspace for building and sharing mini projects inspired by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). Each project is designed to be small, focused, and educational — perfect for practicing specific skills or exploring new technologies.

Whether you're following a roadmap or just browsing for ideas, this repo showcases practical implementations of project suggestions from roadmap.sh, including tools, utilities, and coding challenges.

## Structure
Each folder in this repository contains:
- A standalone mini project
- Its own README with usage instructions
- Source code and any necessary assets

## Contributions
This repo is primarily for personal learning, but feel free to explore, fork, or suggest improvements via issues or pull requests.
